# Home Automation using ESP32

This project implements a Home Automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller, allowing remote control and automation of various home devices.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Control home devices remotely via Wi-Fi.
- **Automation**: Automate tasks based on schedules or triggers.
- **Sensor Integration**: Integrate sensors for environmental monitoring and automation.
- **Web Interface**: Access and control devices through a web-based interface.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Interface with a mobile app for on-the-go control.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to your home devices and sensors as per the wiring diagram provided.
2. **Software Installation**: Install the necessary libraries and dependencies on your development environment.
3. **Configuration**: Configure Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT broker details, and device settings in the code.
4. **Upload Firmware**: Upload the firmware to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
5. **Access Interface**: Access the web interface or mobile app to control and monitor your home devices.
